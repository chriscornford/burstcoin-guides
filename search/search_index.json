We recommend MariaDB as database for the Burst Reference Software.\n\n\nMariaDB\n\n\nThe following \ndocker-compose.yml\n file can be used to run the BRS with MariaDB database in containers.\n\n\nversion\n:\n \n3\n\n\n\nservices\n:\n\n  \nburstcoin\n:\n\n    \nimage\n:\n \nburstcoin/core:1.3.6cg-mariadb\n\n    \nrestart\n:\n \nalways\n\n    \ndepends_on\n:\n\n     \n-\n \nmariadb\n\n    \nports\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n8123:8123\n\n     \n-\n \n8125:8125\n\n  \nmariadb\n:\n\n    \nimage\n:\n \nmariadb:10\n\n    \nenvironment\n:\n\n     \n-\n \nMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=burstwallet\n\n     \n-\n \nMYSQL_DATABASE=burstwallet\n\n    \nvolumes\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n./burst_db:/var/lib/mysql\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file and run it.\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\nWith the \n-d\n flag, both containers are started as background processes. A \nburst_db\n folder will be created in the directory of the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file, if it was not created before. This folder is mounted to the MariaDB storage and holds the \nburstwallet\n database containing the blockchain. The containers can be stopped and removed at any time via \ndocker-compose down\n. With the next start, the \nburst_db\n folder will be mounted again and your previous blockchain status will be loaded.\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nYou may encounter an PoolInitializationError when not clearing containers on restart of the docker-compose.yml. In case there are old containers, remove them with \ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)\n\n\n\n\nH2\n\n\nAlternatively, H2 can be used as database to store the blockchain. H2 is an embedded database, therefore one does not have to run it in a separate container. Simply run the following command.\n\n\ndocker run -p 8123:8123 -p 8125:8125 -v \n$(pwd)\n/burst_db:/etc/burstcoin/burst_db -d burstcoin/core:1.3.6cg-h2\n\n\n\n\n$(pwd)\n/burst_db\n is the path to the folder which is mounted to the H2 storage. If it does not exist a new \nburst_db\n folder is created in the current directory.\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nThe Dockerfiles used to create the Docker images can be found on \nGithub - https://github.com/PoC-Consortium/burstcoin-docker\n\n\n\n\nCustom configuration\n\n\nIn order to use a custom config - \nnxt.properties\n file, you can simply mount a folder containing the \nnxt-default.properties\n and the \nnxt.properties\n to the \n/etc/burstcoin/conf\n mount point.\n\n\nMariaDB\n\n\nversion\n:\n \n3\n\n\n\nservices\n:\n\n  \nburstcoin\n:\n\n    \nimage\n:\n \nburstcoin/core:1.3.6cg-mariadb\n\n    \nrestart\n:\n \nalways\n\n    \ndepends_on\n:\n\n     \n-\n \nmariadb\n\n    \nports\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n8123:8123\n\n     \n-\n \n8125:8125\n\n    \nvolumes\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n./conf:/etc/burstcoin/conf\n\n  \nmariadb\n:\n\n    \nimage\n:\n \nmariadb:10\n\n    \nenvironment\n:\n\n     \n-\n \nMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=burstwallet\n\n     \n-\n \nMYSQL_DATABASE=burstwallet\n\n    \nvolumes\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n./burst_db:/var/lib/mysql\n\n\n\n\n\nH2\n\n\ndocker run -p 8123:8123 -p 8125:8125 -v \n$(pwd)\n/burst_db:/etc/burstcoin/burst_db -v \n$(pwd)\n/conf:/etc/burstcoin/conf -d burstcoin/core:1.3.6cg-h2",

This is the only energy-consuming manipulation and only has to be done once.\n\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how to plot your drives with XPlotter (CPU plotting) without using the AIO client.\n\n\nThe disk space you dedicate to Burst can't be used otherwise once plotted (unless you delete the plot files) so make sure you can truly afford the space dedicated to mining Burst.\n\n\nHDD disk space will be occupied by \nPlot Files\n. Plot files are like bingo cards that contain pre-solved responses to the cryptographic problem that the blockchain poses to miners each and every round. Plot files require a great deal of time and processing power to create.\n\n\nPlotting the disk space you wish to dedicate to mining Burst can be accomplished multiple ways but in this tutorial we will be using \nXPlotter\n, a CPU based plotter that automatically create optimized plot files. This means your plot files will be of the highest possible quality and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\nIf you are using Qbundle, the software is included: just click \"Tools\" -\n \"Plotter\".\u00a0\nIt will simplify the process and it offers an improved interface. A guide is included in the Plotter page of Qbundle - follow the instructions there.\n\n\nOtherwise, download XPlotter\n\u00a0\nand extract it to your desktop or a local directory of your choice.\n\n\n=\n\u00a0 \nDownload on GitHub\n\u00a0\n=\n\n\nNow let's talk about plot files so you can get the gist of the nature of these things :\n\n\nPlot files consist of \nnonces\n which contain the cryptographic solutions you will be mining with.\n\n1 nonce = 262144 bytes\n\nPlot file size is measured in nonces so you'll have to convert the size of your dedicated disk space to nonces. Nonce calculators exist to make this process easier.\n\n\nAlso something very important to understand:\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nNonces are ordered \nlinearly\n in \nsequential order\n. the number they're assigned to is arbitrary but they should \nnever\n\u00a0overlap (overlapping reduces plot efficiency and triggers an error in most mining software).\n\n\n\n\nWith Xplotter that is all the technical knowledge you need to operate the software and to create an optimized plot file.\n\n\nTo execute Xplotter we will have to create a text document and save it as \nrun.bat\n. this batch file will tell Xplotter where and how much to plot and the resources to consume to do so. Follow the next instructions closely :\n\n\n-Go into the Xplotter directory and create a new text document and paste this command line into the notepad :\n\n@setlocal\n@cd /d %~dp0\nXPlotter_avx.exe \n-id\n \nXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n \n-sn\n \nO\n \n-n\n \nP\n \n-t\n \nQ\n \n-path\n \nZ:\\plots\n \n-mem\n \ny\nG\n\n\nAnd we will now fill in the blanks regarding the variables in italics.\n\n\n-id\n = your wallets numerical code. This can be found by clicking your account's name in your wallet and copying the numeric account ID.\n\n\n-sn\n = Starting Nonce (if this is your first time ever plotting I recommend you start your nonce with 0 [ZERO])\n\n\n-n\n = Total nonces\n\n\n-t\u00a0\n= Threads (this refers to your machine's CPU architecture. you should see if it has multi threading otherwise put '1' here)\n\n\n-P\u00a0\n= Path you wish to have your plot file. (mine look like this 'D:/Burst/Plots' any path will suffice really)\n\n\n-mem\n= Gigs of RAM you wish to consume during this process.\n\n\nNever exceed recommended RAM usage! Always leave like 20% remaining RAM for remedial tasks.\n\n\nOnce you've filled out your text document to customize Xplotter to plot your available hard disk space and to limit the resources it will consume then \nSAVE AS\n '\nrun.bat\n' in the Xplotter directory.\n\n\nTo maximize Xplotter's plotting power you're going to want to \nright click\n the \nrun.bat\n and select '\nrun as an administrator\n'.\n\n\n\n\nThis process will consume a great deal of resources if done correctly. You want to plot as fast as possible so crank up the RAM and Thread count if you can.\n\n\nThis may take a while depending on the size of your plot but you can run multiple instances of Xplotter if you have multi threading!\n\n\n-Add one to the last nonce to get the starting nonce of your next plot file. remember sequential is good, overlapping is bad.\n\n\n-Keep a record of your command line(s) that you're currently using so that if you need to pause Xplotter you can re-initiate the same plot by executing the EXACT same command!\n\n\n-Repeat these steps if you'd like to create multiple plot files. We recommend you make your plot files large but not bigger than a few TB as encountering an error after hours or days of plotting can be very frustrating.\n\n\nYou are now plotting!",

You will need to know the pool of your choice's \nserver address\n and \nport\n so you can update the miner.conf file.\n\n\n-You can shop around for pools here : \nPools spreadsheet\n\n\n-And you can see how each pool performs here :\u00a0\nburstcoin.cc/pool\n\n\n=\n Remember to always check if the pool suits the size of your plot files.\n\n\nYou must acquire the pools web address and port and propagate this information throughout the miner.conf document\n.\n\n\nLet's say you are mining at\u00a0\nburstmine.tk\n (the \nPort\n there is :8080), here's how the completed miner.conf document would look:\n\n\n\n\nFurther more beside \"Paths\": in the miner.conf document you will need to refer to all of your completely plotted plot files while maintaining the syntax properly.\n\n\nSo if your plot files are along the paths \"C:\\BURST\\Plots\" and \"E:\\BURST\\Plots\" then this line should look like this:\n\n\"Paths\": [\"C:\\BURST\\Plots\",\"E:\\BURST\\Plots\"],**\n\nNow that you have your miner.conf document prepared properly,\u00a0\nsave\n it.\n\nPassphrases.txt\n\nLet's \ncreate a passphrases.txt document\n within the Blagos directory\n\n\n-Within the Blagos Burst Miner directory create a new text document.\n\n\n-Paste your wallet's passphrase into the document\n\n\n-Save the document as passphrases.txt\n\nSetting the Reward Assignment!\n\n\nBy this time you should already have selected the pool you wish to mine with.\u00a0If not you can find a list of pool wallet addresses above in this tutorial.\n\n\nIf you are using Qbundle, just click \u201cTools\u201d -\n \u201cReward recipient\u201d.\n\n\n-Pick a pool and copy the wallet address onto your clipboard\n\n\n-If you are using Qbundle, just click \u201cTools\u201d -\n \u201cReward recipient\u201d.\n\u00a0\nOtherwise go to this page: \nSet Reward Assignment\n\n\n-Enter the \npool's BURST address\n and your \nmining wallet's passphrase\n in the respective fields.\n\n\nThe pool address for \nburstmine.tk\n is \nBURST-H96D-FT7X-Q5WB-DX23A\n\n\nNow when your pool of choice is dividing up the Burst rewards among the miners it will automatically send your burstcoins to your Burst wallet.\n\n\nRUN BLAGOS!\n\nBlagos should look like this when you start it up:\n\n\n\n\nOptional : Going Solo\n\nConversely if you'd like to mine \nsolo\n then change the miner.conf document to look like this:\n\n\n\n\nAlso, set the \nreward assignment\n to your \nown Burst wallet address\n.\n\n\n\n\nWait 4 block rounds\n and \nstart up Blagos,\n it should look the same as above.\n\nCongratulations! You are now mining Burst!\n\n\nCredit : Gooplanets",
