It is available for all operating systems but does not include added functionnalities like plotting, mining, or passphrase management, unlike Qbundle. This tutorial is going to walk you through getting Burst Core completely set up on any computer running on Windows.\n\n\nPrerequisties\n\n\n\n\nSynchronized Computer Clock\n\n\nWindows 7 or 8 64-bit\n\n\nLatest version of Java 64-bit\n\n\nDual-Core or Better CPU\n\n\n4GB RAM\n\n\n10GB Hard Drive Space\n\n\n\n\nGo to the \ndownload section of the wallet repository\n,  and download the Burst Core wallet on your computer\u2019s desktop (the file should be named \nburstcoin-1.2.9.zip\n or similar, depending to the version of the wallet).\n\n\nExtract the content of the \n.zip\n file to the desired location on your computer.\n\n\n\n\nSynchronizing the Burstcoin blockchain\n\n\nYou have probably heard the term \u201cblockchain\u201d used many times on your way to finding Burst. Basically, the blockchain is all of the records and information for the Burst network. It\u2019s the entire Burst history of everything everyone has done with Burst. The accounts, the transactions, the addresses\u2026everything all kept in order, and all publicly viewable. All of this information is organized neatly into \u201cblocks\u201d and stacked on top of each other into a chain. What you need to do now, is to get the Burst blockchain.\n\n\nNavigate to the folder in which you extracted the content of the \n.zip\n file\n\n\nDoube-click on the file named run.bat\n\n\n\n\nThis will open up the Burst Core client and you will see a bunch of text scrolling by.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it is doing is connecting to the network. After it gets some connections established to other Burst nodes that are running, it\u2019ll check to see if it has an up to date blockchain. You won\u2019t have it, so it will start downloading it. It will create a new folder named burst_db in your installation folder, and will be processing and adding the blockchain history to a couple files in there. These files are burst.mv.db and burst.trace.db . Now, this process will most likely take several hours, so you need to leave your computer running and connected to the internet. You can go about whatever else you need to do on the computer.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n: If you need to close down the Burst client, or reboot your computer, you should try to do so \u201cgracefully\u201d. First, click on the window of the Burst client program. Next hold down the Ctrl button and hit the C button twice. This is the best way to shut down Burst to keep the blockchain file from being corrupted.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll see on the screen that the Burst client is processing blocks, and will do so until it catches up with the current block. This can take anywhere from several hours to days. The speed of this is determined by a lot of different factors:\n\n\n\n\nNodes you are connected to\n\n\nYour internet connection\n\n\nYour computer specifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Burstcoin core wallet has been installed and can be found on \nhttp://localhost:8125\n\n\nQbundle",
