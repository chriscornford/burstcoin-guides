## Mining

After the drives have been plotted, they can be mined with an appropriate miner. One of the following miners can be selected:

* [creepMiner by Creepsky](https://github.com/Creepsky/creepMiner/wiki/Compilation-&-Installation) (CPU)
* [Blago's Miner](https://github.com/Blagodarenko/miner-burst) (CPU)
* [jminer by de-luxe](https://github.com/de-luxe/burstcoin-jminer) (GPU)

!!! tip
    We recommend to use creepMiner due its easy setup and detailed documentation for Linux.
